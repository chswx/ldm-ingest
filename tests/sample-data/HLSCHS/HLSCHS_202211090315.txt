SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Tropical Storm Nicole continues to approach the bahamas and the
east coast of Florida Tuesday night. Nicole is expected make landfall
in Florida Wednesday night, then will turn north Thursday. Nicole
should then pass over or just inland of our region Thursday night into
Friday. 

Significant impacts will extend well north of Nicole's center. Impacts
are expected to include dangerous storm surge inundation, especially
around the times of high tide, locally excessive rainfall especially
Thursday and Thursday night, and tropical storm force winds capable of
bringing down some trees and tree limbs, particularly late Thursday
into Friday. In addition, dangerous marine and surf conditions as well
as significant beach erosion are expected.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* SURGE:
Prepare for life-threatening surge having possible significant 
impacts across coastal areas. Potential impacts in 
this area include:
    - Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and 
      in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with 
      storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several 
      buildings, mainly near the coast.
    - Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become 
      weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low 
      spots.
    - Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching 
      dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
    - Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and 
      piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings, 
      especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids 
      possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult 
      navigation near inlets and waterways.

Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia, 
little to no impact is anticipated.

* FLOODING RAIN:
Prepare for dangerous rainfall flooding having possible significant 
impacts across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. 
Potential impacts include:
    - Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.
    - Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with 
      swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places, 
      especially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, 
      canals, and ditches overflow.
    - Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations. 
      Several places could experience expanded areas of rapid 
      inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage 
      areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as 
      storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions 
      become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.

* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
Expect high surf, beach erosion and dangerous rip currents on area beaches.  

* WIND:
Prepare for hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across 
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts 
include:
    - Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored 
      mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
    - Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted, 
      but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow 
      rooted.
    - Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within urban 
      or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving conditions on 
      bridges and other elevated roadways, especially for high 
      profile vehicles.
    - Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.

* TORNADOES:
Prepare for a tornado event having possible limited impacts across 
southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. Potential impacts 
include:
    - Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans.
    - Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along with 
      power and communications disruptions.
    - In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, vehicles, 
      boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and other poorly 
      constructed structures.


PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
----------------------------------

When making safety and preparedness decisions, do not focus on the 
exact forecast track since hazards such as flooding rain, damaging 
wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes extend well away from the 
center of the storm. 

When securing your property, outside preparations should be concluded 
as soon as possible before conditions deteriorate. The onset of 
strong gusty winds or flooding can cause certain preparedness 
activities to become unsafe.

Closely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather Radio and local news 
outlets for official storm information. Listen for possible changes 
to the forecast.

There is a threat from tornadoes with this storm. Have multiple ways 
to receive Tornado Warnings. Be ready to shelter quickly.
