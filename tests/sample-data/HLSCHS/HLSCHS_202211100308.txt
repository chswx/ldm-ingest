SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Hurricane Nicole will make landfall in Florida tonight, then will
weaken as it moves north, passing inland of our area Thursday night
into Friday.

Multiple hazards will extend well north and east of Nicole's center.
Significant coastal flooding is expected with the high tide Thursday
morning, with minor coastal flooding possible Friday morning as well.
Also, locally heavy rainfall is possible, especially Thursday and
Thursday night. A few tornadoes could occur Thursday afternoon into
Friday. Tropical storm force wind gusts are expected along the coast
tonight through Thursday, then the probability for tropical storm
force winds will decrease as Nicole weakens. Finally, expect dangerous
marine and surf conditions and significant beach erosion to continue
until late week.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* SURGE:
Protect against life-threatening surge having possible significant 
impacts across coastal counties. Potential impacts in 
this area include:
    - Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines and 
      in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and creeks, with 
      storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. Damage to several 
      buildings, mainly near the coast.
    - Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads become 
      weakened or washed out, especially in normally vulnerable low 
      spots.
    - Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching 
      dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
    - Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and 
      piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings, 
      especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids 
      possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult 
      navigation near inlets and waterways.

Elsewhere across inland southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia, 
little to no impact is anticipated.

* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant 
impacts across the region. Potential impacts 
include:
    - Isolated to scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution of 
      emergency plans.
    - Scattered locations could experience enhanced damage due to 
      tornadoes with a few spots of considerable damage, power loss, 
      and communications failures.
    - Scattered locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, 
      mobile homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees 
      snapped or uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed 
      about.

Protect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts 
across the region.

* OTHER COASTAL HAZARDS:
High surf, significant beach erosion, rip currents and dangerous marine
conditions are expected.

* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible 
significant impacts across the area. Potential 
impacts include:
    - Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.
    - Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with 
      swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places, 
      especially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, 
      canals, and ditches overflow.
    - Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations. 
      Several places could experience expanded areas of rapid 
      inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage 
      areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as 
      storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions 
      become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.

Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible 
limited impacts across the region.

* WIND:
Protect against hazardous wind having possible limited impacts across 
coastal counties. Potential impacts in this area include:
    - Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored 
      mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about.
    - Large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted, 
      but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow 
      rooted.
    - Some roads impassable due to debris, particularly within urban 
      or heavily wooded locations. Hazardous driving conditions on 
      bridges and other elevated roadways, especially for high 
      profile vehicles.
    - Isolated to scattered power and communications outages.

Elsewhere across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia, 
little to no impact is anticipated.
