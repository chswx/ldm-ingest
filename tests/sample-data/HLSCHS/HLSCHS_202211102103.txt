SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------

Tropical Storm Nicole will turn northward through the Florida
Panhandle this evening and into central Georgia as it further weakens
to a tropical depression by Friday morning. Nicole will then jog
northeastward through the Carolinas through the day Friday.

Expect multiple hazards across the area, well north and east of
Nicole's center. Conditions will remain favorable for a few tornadoes
late this afternoon through much of tonight. Locally heavy rainfall
will continue late this afternoon and through the overnight hours.
Another round of minor coastal flooding is possible with high tides
this evening and again Friday morning. Tropical storm force wind gusts
of 40 to 50 mph will persist in the coastal waters through tonight,
although tropical storm force wind gusts could occur within any
showers that cross the region. Finally, expect dangerous marine and
surf conditions and significant beach erosion to continue until late
Friday.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

* TORNADOES:
Protect against a dangerous tornado event having possible significant 
impacts across southeast South Carolina and southeast Georgia. 
Potential impacts include:
    - Isolated to scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution of 
      emergency plans.
    - Scattered locations could experience enhanced damage due to 
      tornadoes with a few spots of considerable damage, power loss, 
      and communications failures.
    - Scattered locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, 
      mobile homes demolished, boxcars overturned, large trees 
      snapped or uprooted, vehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed 
      about.

* FLOODING RAIN:
Protect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible 
significant impacts across the area. Potential impacts include:
    - Moderate rainfall flooding could prompt some rescues.
    - Rivers and tributaries could quickly become swollen with 
      swifter currents and overspill their banks in a few places, 
      especially in normally vulnerable spots. Small streams, creeks, 
      canals, and ditches overflow.
    - Flood waters can enter some structures or weaken foundations. 
      Several places could experience expanded areas of rapid 
      inundation at underpasses, low-lying spots, and poor drainage 
      areas. Some streets and parking lots take on moving water as 
      storm drains and retention ponds overflow. Driving conditions 
      become hazardous. Some road and bridge closures.

Protect against locally hazardous rainfall flooding having possible 
limited impacts across the region.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS
