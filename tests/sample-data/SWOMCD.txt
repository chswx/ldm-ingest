AREAS AFFECTED...EAST TX...WESTERN LA

CONCERNING...SEVERE POTENTIAL...WATCH POSSIBLE 

VALID 081646Z - 081815Z

PROBABILITY OF WATCH ISSUANCE...40 PERCENT

SUMMARY...THUNDERSTORMS ARE SLOWLY DEVELOPING OVER PARTS OF
SOUTHEAST TX...IN REGION OF STRONG LOW LEVEL AND DEEP LAYER VERTICAL
SHEAR.  ORGANIZATION INTO SEVERE STORMS IS NOT IMMINENT...BUT AREA
IS BEING MONITORED FOR INTENSIFICATION AND POSSIBLE WW.

DISCUSSION...THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORMING NORTH/NORTHEAST OF
HOU...TRACKING NORTHEASTWARD AT 35-40 KT.  LOCAL VAD PROFILES AT
HGX/LCH/POE/SHV ALL SHOW SIGNIFICANT VEERING/INCREASING WINDS WITH
HEIGHT...REPRESENTATIVE OF STRONG LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION AND LIFT.
 THIS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN CONTINUED BLOSSOMING OF CONVECTION
ACROSS THE REGION DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  INSTABILITY IS WEAK
BUT SUFFICIENT...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S AND MUCAPE VALUES OF
500-1000 J/KG.  VAD HODOGRAPHS SHOW FAVORABLE LOW LEVEL AND DEEP
LAYER VERTICAL SHEAR PROFILES FOR SEVERE STORMS...BUT CONSENSUS OF
CAM SOLUTIONS SUGGEST THIS ACTIVITY WILL REMAIN MOSTLY DISORGANIZED.
 GIVEN THE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT... CONVECTIVE TRENDS WILL BE
MONITORED FOR INTENSIFICATION AND POSSIBLE WW ISSUANCE.
