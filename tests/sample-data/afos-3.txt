...STORM SURGE WATCH IN EFFECT...
...TROPICAL STORM WATCH IN EFFECT...

A Storm Surge Watch means life-threatening inundation, from rising 
water moving inland from the coastline, is possible somewhere within 
this area within the next 48 hours

A Tropical Storm Watch means tropical storm-force winds are possible 
somewhere within this area within the next 48 hours

* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
    - Charleston
    - McClellanville
    - Edisto Island

* WIND
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Tropical Storm force wind
        - Peak Wind Forecast: 30-40 mph with gusts to 55 mph
        - Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday afternoon 
          until early Thursday morning

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 58 
      to 73 mph
        - PLAN: Plan for dangerous wind of equivalent strong tropical 
          storm force.
        - PREPARE: Efforts to protect life and property should now be 
          underway. Prepare for significant wind damage.
        - ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind 
          becomes hazardous.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
        - Some damage to roofing and siding materials, along with 
          damage to porches, awnings, carports, and sheds. A few 
          buildings experiencing window, door, and garage door 
          failures. Mobile homes damaged, especially if unanchored. 
          Unsecured lightweight objects become dangerous projectiles.
        - Several large trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater 
          numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted.
        - Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within 
          urban or heavily wooded places. A few bridges and access 
          routes impassable.
        - Travel by vehicle or on foot increasingly difficult. Danger 
          of death or injury from falling objects such as trees or 
          electric wires outside.
        - Scattered power and communications outages, but more 
          prevalent in areas with above ground lines, which could 
          persist for hours or days.
        - Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from 
          their moorings.

* STORM SURGE
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
        - Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet 
          above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
        - Window of concern: Wednesday afternoon until early Thursday 
          morning

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm 
      surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
        - PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of 
          greater than 3 feet above ground.
        - PREPARE: Storm surge flooding preparations should be 
          underway. Assemble disaster supplies and know your 
          evacuation route.
        - ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area. 
          Failure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of 
          your life.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
        - Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines 
          and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and 
          creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. 
          Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
        - Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads 
          become weakened or washed out, especially in normally 
          vulnerable low spots.
        - Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching 
          dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
        - Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and 
          piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings, 
          especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids 
          possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult 
          navigation near inlets and waterways.

* FLOODING RAIN
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: 
        - Peak Rainfall Amounts: 3-6 inches, with locally higher 
          amounts

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major 
      flooding rain
        - PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for 
          major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are 
          likely.
        - PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially 
          if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
        - ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take 
          action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
        - Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
        - Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks 
          in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, 
          ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems 
          and barriers could become stressed.
        - Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple 
          communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are 
          washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape 
          routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving 
          water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become 
          dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened 
          or washed out.
        - Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively 
          impacted.
        - Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be 
          present in flood waters.

* TORNADO
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: 
        - Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few 
      tornadoes
        - PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a 
          few tornadoes.
        - PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to 
          tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before 
          hazardous weather arrives.
        - ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter 
          quickly.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
        - Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency 
          plans.
        - Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along 
          with power and communications disruptions.
        - In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, 
          vehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and 
          other poorly constructed structures.

          persist for hours or days.
        - Some poorly secured small craft could break loose from 
          their moorings.

* STORM SURGE
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Life-threatening storm surge possible
        - Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 2-4 feet 
          above ground somewhere within surge prone areas
        - Window of concern: Wednesday afternoon until early Thursday 
          morning

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for storm 
      surge flooding greater than 3 feet above ground
        - PLAN: Plan for life-threatening storm surge flooding of 
          greater than 3 feet above ground.
        - PREPARE: Storm surge flooding preparations should be 
          underway. Assemble disaster supplies and know your 
          evacuation route.
        - ACT: Leave if evacuation orders are given for your area. 
          Failure to heed evacuation orders may result in the loss of 
          your life.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Significant
        - Areas of inundation of saltwater along immediate shorelines 
          and in low-lying spots farther inland near rivers and 
          creeks, with storm surge flooding accentuated by waves. 
          Damage to several buildings, mainly near the coast.
        - Sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary roads 
          become weakened or washed out, especially in normally 
          vulnerable low spots.
        - Moderate to major beach erosion with heavy surf breaching 
          dunes. Strong and numerous rip currents.
        - Minor to moderate damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and 
          piers. Several small craft broken away from moorings, 
          especially in unprotected anchorages. Some navigation aids 
          possibly displaced well off station, creating difficult 
          navigation near inlets and waterways.

* FLOODING RAIN
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: 
        - Peak Rainfall Amounts: 3-6 inches, with locally higher 
          amounts

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major 
      flooding rain
        - PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for 
          major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are 
          likely.
        - PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially 
          if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
        - ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take 
          action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
        - Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
        - Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks 
          in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, 
          ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems 
          and barriers could become stressed.
        - Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple 
          communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are 
          washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape 
          routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving 
          water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become 
          dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened 
          or washed out.
        - Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively 
          impacted.
        - Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be 
          present in flood waters.

* TORNADO
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: 
        - Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few 
      tornadoes
        - PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a 
          few tornadoes.
        - PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to 
          tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before 
          hazardous weather arrives.
        - ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter 
          quickly.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
        - Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency 
          plans.
        - Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along 
          with power and communications disruptions.
        - In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, 
          vehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and 
          other poorly constructed structures.

          action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
        - Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
        - Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks 
          in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, 
          ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems 
          and barriers could become stressed.
        - Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple 
          communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are 
          washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape 
          routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving 
          water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become 
          dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened 
          or washed out.
        - Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively 
          impacted.
        - Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be 
          present in flood waters.

* TORNADO
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: 
        - Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few 
      tornadoes
        - PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a 
          few tornadoes.
        - PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to 
          tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before 
          hazardous weather arrives.
        - ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter 
          quickly.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
        - Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency 
          plans.
        - Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along 
          with power and communications disruptions.
        - In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, 
          vehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and 
          other poorly constructed structures.

        - ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take 
          action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
        - Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
        - Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks 
          in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, 
          ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems 
          and barriers could become stressed.
        - Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple 
          communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are 
          washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape 
          routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving 
          water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become 
          dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened 
          or washed out.
        - Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively 
          impacted.
        - Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be 
          present in flood waters.

* TORNADO
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: 
        - Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few 
      tornadoes
        - PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a 
          few tornadoes.
        - PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to 
          tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before 
          hazardous weather arrives.
        - ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter 
          quickly.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
        - Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency 
          plans.
        - Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along 
          with power and communications disruptions.
        - In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, 
          vehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and 
          other poorly constructed structures.

...TROPICAL STORM WATCH IN EFFECT...

A Tropical Storm Watch means tropical storm-force winds are possible 
somewhere within this area within the next 48 hours

* LOCATIONS AFFECTED
    - Townsend
    - South Newport

* WIND
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Equivalent Strong Tropical Storm force 
      wind
        - Peak Wind Forecast: 55-70 mph with gusts to 85 mph
        - Window for Tropical Storm force winds: Wednesday morning 
          until early Thursday morning

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for wind 74 
      to 110 mph
        - PLAN: Plan for life-threatening wind of equivalent CAT 1 or 
          2 hurricane force.
        - PREPARE: Efforts to protect life and property should now be 
          rigorously underway. Prepare for considerable wind damage.
        - ACT: Act now to complete preparations before the wind 
          becomes hazardous.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
        - Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some 
          window, door, and garage door failures leading to 
          structural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some 
          destroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles. Some 
          locations may be uninhabitable for weeks. 
        - Danger of death or injury from falling objects and airborne 
          projectiles outside.
        - Large trees snapped or uprooted.
        - Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within 
          urban or heavily wooded locations. Several bridges and 
          access routes impassable.
        - Large areas with power and communications outages, which 
          could persist for days.
        - Several secured small craft could break free from moorings.

* STORM SURGE
    - No storm surge inundation forecast

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Little to no storm 
      surge flooding
        - PLAN: There is little to no threat of storm surge flooding. 
          Rough surf, coastal erosion, and life-threatening rip 
          currents are possible.
        - PREPARE: Little to no preparations for storm surge flooding 
          are needed.
        - ACT: Follow the instructions of local officials. Monitor 
          forecasts.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Little to None
        - Little to no potential impacts from saltwater inundation.

* FLOODING RAIN
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: 
        - Peak Rainfall Amounts: 3-6 inches, with locally higher 
          amounts

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for major 
      flooding rain
        - PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for 
          major flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are 
          likely.
        - PREPARE: Strongly consider protective actions, especially 
          if you are in an area vulnerable to flooding.
        - ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take 
          action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive
        - Major rainfall flooding could prompt many rescues.
        - Rivers and tributaries could rapidly overflow their banks 
          in multiple locations. Small streams, creeks, canals, 
          ditches may become dangerous rivers. Flood control systems 
          and barriers could become stressed.
        - Flood waters could enter many structures within multiple 
          communities; some structures become uninhabitable or are 
          washed away. Flood waters could cover multiple escape 
          routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of moving 
          water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become 
          dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some weakened 
          or washed out.
        - Drinking water and sewer services could be negatively 
          impacted.
        - Hazardous containers and materials could possibly be 
          present in flood waters.

* TORNADO
    - LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: 
        - Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes

    - THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY THAT INCLUDES TYPICAL FORECAST 
      UNCERTAINTY IN TRACK, SIZE AND INTENSITY: Potential for a few 
      tornadoes
        - PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a 
          few tornadoes.
        - PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to 
          tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before 
          hazardous weather arrives.
        - ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter 
          quickly.

    - POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
        - Isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency 
          plans.
        - Isolated locations could experience tornado damage, along 
          with power and communications disruptions.
        - In isolated locations, tornadoes could damage trees, 
          vehicles, boats and buildings, especially mobile homes and 
          other poorly constructed structures.
