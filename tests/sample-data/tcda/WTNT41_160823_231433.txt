POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE FIONA DISCUSSION NUMBER  27
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL062016
1100 AM AST TUE AUG 23 2016

Satellite images indicate that Fiona has lost even more
organization this morning with only a weak, elongated circulation
and no organized deep convection.  Thus, Fiona no longer meets the
requirements of a tropical cyclone and this is the last advisory.
The initial wind speed is reduced to 25 kt in accordance with the
latest Dvorak estimates.  While wind shear is forecast to decrease,
the low's structure has lost so much organization that it is not
likely to take advantage of the more conducive conditions.  In
addition, dry mid-level air near the circulation is likely to limit
any organized convection. Thus regeneration is not expected at this
time.  The low should move northwestward into a break in the
subtropical ridge, then westward as the ridge restrengthens.
