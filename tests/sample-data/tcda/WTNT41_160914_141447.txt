TROPICAL STORM JULIA DISCUSSION NUMBER   3
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL112016
1100 AM EDT WED SEP 14 2016

Julia is estimated to be maintaining 35-kt winds, based on WSR 88-D
Doppler velocity data, well offshore of the coast.  Since the
system will continue to interact with land, weakening is forecast
and the cyclone is expected to become a remnant low in a couple of
days.  The official intensity forecast is close to the latest
D-SHIPS and LGEM guidance.  There is a possibility, however, that
the system could strengthen if it moves far enough out over water.

The center of Julia may be reforming closer to the Georgia coast,
although the surface observations are not yet definitive, and the
initial motion is a highly uncertain 030/5 kt.  The tropical
cyclone is likely to remain in weak steering currents near the axis
of the subtropical ridge, and the track guidance models indicate
that some erratic motion is likely over the next couple of days.
The official forecast shows a very slow motion after 12 hours, and
is east of the previous NHC track.

The slow forward speed of Julia is expected to result in locally
heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum amounts near
10 inches along portions of the South Carolina coastline.  These
rains could result in flash flooding.
