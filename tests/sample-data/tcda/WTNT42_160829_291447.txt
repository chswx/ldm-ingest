HURRICANE GASTON DISCUSSION NUMBER  28
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL072016
1100 AM AST MON AUG 29 2016

Over the past few hours, the satellite presentation of Gaston has
become slightly less organized, with decreasing convection noted in
the eyewall.  Satellite estimates are a bit lower, so the initial
wind speed is reduced to 95 kt.  Little change in intensity is
expected for the next couple of days while Gaston remains over warm
waters with light-to-moderate shear.  Thereafter, a gradual
increase in shear, along with a decrease in SSTs, should cause a
more significant weakening.  The latest NHC intensity forecast is
simply an update of the previous one since the guidance continues
to be in fairly good agreement.

Gaston is still drifting northward. The steering currents should
become better defined tomorrow as a ridge becomes established to
the south of the cyclone.  The ridge should cause Gaston to
accelerate to the east-northeast over the next few days, although
the cyclone stays south of the main belt of mid-latitude
westerlies.  Guidance is coming into better agreement on the system
approaching the Azores in about 5 days, although there are some
speed differences.  No significant changes were made to the
previous forecast, which lies near or just south of the model
consensus.
