HURRICANE GASTON DISCUSSION NUMBER  36
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL072016
1100 AM AST WED AUG 31 2016

The satellite appearance of Gaston has degraded somewhat during the
past few hours, with a slightly cooler eye noted.  A blend of the
latest Dvorak estimates suggest an initial wind speed of 100 kt for
this advisory.  Only a slow weakening is anticipated over the next
couple of days while the hurricane moves over gradually cooling
waters in moderate shear conditions.  Almost all of the guidance
show Gaston near hurricane strength in a couple of days as it
approaches the Azores.  The latest NHC intensity forecast is lower
than the previous one, and best fits the model consensus.

Gaston has begun to move faster toward the east-northeast, now at
about 13 kt.  The hurricane should accelerate in that general
direction over the next couple of days as it moves within the
mid-latitude westerlies.  Most of the models have this system in
the vicinity of the Azores in about 2 days, and the official
forecast will continue to show this solution.

A hurricane or tropical storm watch will likely be issued for the
central or western Azores this afternoon.
