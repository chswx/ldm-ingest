POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE GASTON DISCUSSION NUMBER  47
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL072016
500 AM AST SAT SEP 03 2016

Gaston has been devoid of deep convection for more than 12 hours,
and is now a swirl of stratocumulus clouds. Since the cyclone is
moving over 22-23 deg C waters and embedded in northwesterly shear
of about 35 kt, the likelihood that any new convection would reform
is slim.  Given this, Gaston is being declared a post-tropical
remnant low on this advisory. Without any new convection
redeveloping the vortex is expected to spin down rather quickly, and
global models show Gaston opening up into a trough in about 18
hours.

The initial motion estimate is 065/15.  The post-tropical cyclone
should accelerate east-northeastward at the base of the mid-
latitude westerlies today, and then turn northeastward ahead of a
trough digging over Atlantic Canada prior to dissipation on Sunday.

This is the last advisory issued on Gaston by the National
Hurricane Center.  Additional information on this system can be
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France under WMO header
FQNT50 LFPW and available on the web at
