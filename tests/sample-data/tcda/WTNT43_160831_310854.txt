TROPICAL DEPRESSION EIGHT DISCUSSION NUMBER  12
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL082016
500 AM EDT WED AUG 31 2016

The low-level center is difficult to find, but given the strong
westerly shear and continuity, it is assumed that it is located to
the west of a large area of deep convection devoid of banding
features. Dvorak numbers have not changed, and the initial intensity
remains at 30 kt. Most of the guidance shows a significant increase
in the shear, but at the same time forecasts a slight increase in
intensity. The NHC forecast follows the guidance and the previous
forecast showing a slight increase in the winds before the cyclone
becomes extratropical in 48 hours.

The depression is moving slowly toward the northeast at 4 kt, and
is already embedded within the southwesterly flow ahead of an
amplifying mid-latitude trough. This pattern favors a continuation
of the northeast track away from the U.S coast with a significant
increase in forward speed.
