REMNANTS OF EIGHT DISCUSSION NUMBER  16

500 AM AST THU SEP 01 2016

Deep convection is now displaced more than 100 nm east of the
location suspected to be the center of the tropical depression.
However, the 0224Z ASCAT scatterometer overpass showed that the
system has opened up into a trough.  Thus the system is no longer
considered to be a tropical cyclone.  Maximum winds continue to be
around 25 kt, associated with the remnants of the tropical cyclone.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and available on the Web
at http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.shtml.
