CORRECTED FIRST PARAGRAPH OCEAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

The tropical cyclone's cloud pattern has not become better organized
this afternoon, with the low-level center partially exposed just to
the north of a ragged-looking area of deep convection.  Observations
from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft support keeping the intensity
at 30 kt at this time.  Given the system's currently disorganized
appearance, it does not seem likely that there will be much
strengthening in the short term.  Since the cyclone will be moving
over very warm waters and in an environment of moderate westerly
shear, however, gradual intensification is expected during the next
couple of days.  When the system nears the Florida Gulf coast,
increasing upper-level winds should limit strengthening.  The
official intensity forecast is close to the model consensus.

Based on fixes from the NOAA aircraft, the motion is a slow 290/4
kt.  There is little change to the expected steering flow evolution.
In 2-3 days, a mid-tropospheric trough is forecast to begin digging
over the southeastern United States.  This feature should cause the
tropical cyclone to turn toward the right while it moves over the
eastern Gulf, and to accelerate northeastward across northern
Florida.  The official track forecast is essentially a blend of the
latest ECMWF and GFS predictions.

Given the current forecast, a tropical storm or hurricane watch may
be required for a portion of the Florida Gulf coast as early as
tomorrow morning.
