TROPICAL STORM HERMINE SPECIAL DISCUSSION NUMBER  17
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL092016
1200 PM CDT THU SEP 01 2016

Reports from a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that
the extent of tropical-storm-force winds has increased
significantly in the eastern semicircle.  This requires an
extension of the tropical storm warning southward along both
Florida coasts.  This Special Advisory is being issued to modify
the warnings, and to update the analyzed and forecast wind radii.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. It is important to not focus on the exact forecast track.
Hermine is an extremely asymmetric storm, with a large extent of
dangerous winds, life-threatening storm surge, and flooding rains
well to the east and southeast of the path of the center.

2. Hermine is expected to undergo a complex interaction with a
frontal system when it reaches the Carolinas over the weekend.  It
is a little early to say what the specific impacts will be for the
mid-Atlantic and northeastern states.
