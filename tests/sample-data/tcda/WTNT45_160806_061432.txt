REMNANTS OF EARL DISCUSSION NUMBER  17
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL052016
1000 AM CDT SAT AUG 06 2016

The circulation of Earl has become disrupted by the high terrain of
Mexico, and since the cyclone no longer has a well-defined surface
circulation, it is declared dissipated.

The remnants, however, should continue to move westward and interact
with an area of disturbed weather along the Pacific coast of Mexico,
which could lead to the formation of a tropical cyclone in that area
in about 2 to 3 days.

This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center
on Earl.
