TROPICAL STORM IAN DISCUSSION NUMBER  13
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL102016

After looking more like a subtropical cyclone than a tropical
cyclone for most of the past 24 hours, there has recently been an
increase in convective banding over the eastern semicircle of Ian.
The initial intensity remains 45 kt based on a subtropical cyclone
intensity estimate from TAFB.  Ian is forecast to merge with the
westerlies and undergo extratropical transition during the next
36-48 hours, and in the process it is expected to strengthen to at
least storm-force before it is absorbed by another extratropical
low. The new intensity forecast is an update of the previous
forecast based on the global models and guidance from the Ocean
Prediction Center

Ian is accelerating northeastward and the initial motion is now
040/21.  A northeastward motion with an additional increase in
forward speed is expected before the cyclone is absorbed.  The new
forecast track is near the center of the tightly clustered track
guidance.
