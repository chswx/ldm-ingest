POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE IAN DISCUSSION NUMBER  17
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL102016
1100 AM AST FRI SEP 16 2016

Ian has transitioned into an extratropical low this morning.  Any of
the remaining weak-to-moderate convection is the northern side of
the circulation, with cold air wrapping into the center of the
cyclone as it is overtaken by a cold front.  The initial intensity
of 55 kt is based on ASCAT data.  Ian should move quickly
northeastward and gradually weaken before a larger extratropical low
absorbs it in about 2 days.  The track, intensity, and wind radii
forecasts are based largely on guidance from the Ocean Prediction
Center.
