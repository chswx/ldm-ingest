DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was
located near latitude 30.3 North, longitude 81.6 West. Julia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue tonight with a reduction in forward
speed tomorrow.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours. Little change
in strength is expected tonight.  Julia is forecast to weaken to a
tropical depression by late Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km),
mainly to the northeast and southeast of the center. Recent
observations indicate that sustained tropical-storm-force winds are
occurring along the northeast coast of Florida from Ponte Vedra
northward to the mouth of the St. Johns River.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1009 mb (29.80 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

WIND: Tropical-storm-force winds are already occuring within the
tropical storm warning area.

RAINFALL: Julia is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rain near
the northeast Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina coastlines
through Friday afternoon. Isolated totals of 10 inches are possible.
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding. Flooding may be further
compounded with persistent strong onshore flow reducing river and
stream discharges.

through Wednesday morning across parts of northeastern Florida and
southeastern Georgia.
