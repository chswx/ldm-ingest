DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was
located near latitude 30.5 North, longitude 81.8 West. Julia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue overnight with a reduction in
forward speed later today.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected overnight. Julia is
forecast to weaken to a tropical depression by late Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km),
mainly over water to the northeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1011 mb (29.85 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical-storm-force winds are already occuring within
portions of the tropical storm warning area.

RAINFALL: Julia is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rain near
the northeast Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina coastlines
through Friday afternoon. Isolated totals of 10 inches are possible.
This rainfall could lead to flash flooding. Flooding may be further
compounded with persistent strong onshore flow reducing river and
stream discharges.

TORNADOES: An isolated tornado or two will be possible through
this morning across parts of northeastern Florida and southeastern
Georgia.
