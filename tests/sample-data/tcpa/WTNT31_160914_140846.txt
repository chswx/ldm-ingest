DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was
located near latitude 30.9 North, longitude 81.8 West. Julia is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h). A reduction in
forward speed is expected today, and Julia is forecast to drift
northward over eastern Georgia during the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast during the next day or so, and Julia
is expected to weaken to a tropical depression later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
primarily over water to the northeast of the center.  A wind gust
of 39 mph (63 km/h) was recently reported at St. Simons Island,
Georgia.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1012 mb (29.89 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical-storm-force winds are already occuring within
portions of the tropical storm warning area.  Wind gusts to
tropical storm force are possible elsewhere along the coast of
Georgia and southern South Carolina this morning.

RAINFALL: Julia is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rain near
the Georgia and South Carolina coastlines through Friday afternoon.
Isolated totals of 10 inches are possible.  This rainfall could lead
to flash flooding. Flooding may be further compounded with
persistent strong onshore flow reducing river and stream discharges.
Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible across
northeast Florida today.

TORNADOES: An isolated tornado is possible across coastal Georgia
and southern South Carolina today.
