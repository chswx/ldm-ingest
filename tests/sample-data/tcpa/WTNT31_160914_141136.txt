DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Julia was
located near latitude 31.2 North, longitude 81.7 West.  Julia is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A reduction in
forward speed is expected today, and Julia is forecast to drift
northward over eastern Georgia during the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next day or so, and
Julia is expected to weaken to a tropical depression later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
primarily over water to the northeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1011 mb (29.85 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Wind gusts to tropical storm force are possible along
portions of the coasts of Georgia and southern South Carolina this
morning.

RAINFALL: Julia is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rain near
the Georgia and South Carolina coastlines through Friday afternoon.
Isolated totals of 10 inches are possible.  This rainfall could lead
to flash flooding.  Flooding may be further compounded with
persistent strong onshore flow reducing river and stream discharges.
Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible across
northeast Florida today.

TORNADOES: An isolated tornado is possible across coastal Georgia
and southern South Carolina today.
