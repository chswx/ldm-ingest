South Carolina and North Carolina by Monday afternoon or evening.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The interaction of Julia with a weak cold front pushing
slowly eastward across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states
is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches
across eastern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region northward into
eastern New York and southern New England through Tuesday.  Isolated
maximum amounts of 8 inches will be possible, especially over
portions of eastern North Carolina northward into parts of eastern
Virginia, eastern Maryland, Delaware, and southern New Jersey.
These amounts could result in localized flooding or flash flooding.
