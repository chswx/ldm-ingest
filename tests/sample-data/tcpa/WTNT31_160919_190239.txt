At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Julia
was located near latitude 32.2 North, longitude 78.4 West. The low

expected to continue into Tuesday.  The system is expected to be
near the coast of southeastern North Carolina Monday afternoon or
evening.

Maximum sustained winds are near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: The interaction of the remnants of Julia with a weak cold
front pushing slowly eastward across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
states is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 2 to 4
inches across eastern portions of the Mid-Atlantic region northward
into eastern New York and southern New England through Tuesday.
Isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches will be possible, especially
over portions of eastern North Carolina northward into parts of
eastern Virginia, eastern Maryland, Delaware, and southern New
Jersey. These amounts could result in localized flooding or flash
flooding.
