DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gaston was located
near latitude 38.0 North, longitude 39.2 West.  Gaston is moving
toward the east-northeast near 24 mph (39 km/h), and this motion is
forecast to continue for the next couple of days with a decrease in
forward speed expected on Friday.  On the forecast track, the center
of Gaston will move near the western Azores on Friday and pass north
of the central Azores on Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and
Gaston is expected to become a tropical storm by early Friday before
it reaches the western Azores.  Gaston is expected to become a post-
tropical cyclone on Saturday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km), mainly
to the south and east of the center, and tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the western Azores
on Friday and in the central Azores Friday night.

RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches, primarily over the western Azores, through the
weekend.

SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston will begin affecting the Azores
tonight and continue into Saturday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.
