DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gaston was located
near latitude 38.3 North, longitude 37.5 West.  Gaston is moving
toward the east-northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h).  An east-
northeastward motion at a decreasing forward speed is expected
through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Gaston will
move near the western Azores on Friday and pass north of the central
Azores on Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours, and Gaston is expected to become a tropical storm by early
Friday before it reaches the western Azores.  Gaston is expected to
become a post-tropical cyclone on Saturday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km),
mainly to the south and east of the center.  Tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the western Azores
on Friday and in the central Azores Friday night.

RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
1 to 3 inches, primarily over the western Azores, through the
weekend.

SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston will begin affecting the Azores
tonight and continue into Saturday.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.
