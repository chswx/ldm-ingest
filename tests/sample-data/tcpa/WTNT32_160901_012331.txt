DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gaston was located
near latitude 38.3 North, longitude 37.3 West.  Gaston is moving
toward the east-northeast near 25 mph (40 km/h).  An east-
northeastward motion at a decreasing forward speed is expected
through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Gaston will
move near the western Azores on Friday and pass north of the central
Azores on Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Gaston
is expected to become a tropical storm by early Friday before it
reaches the western Azores.  Gaston is expected to become a
post-tropical cyclone on Saturday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km),
mainly to the south and east of the center.  Tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

on Friday and in the central Azores Friday night.

RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
1 to 3 inches, primarily over the western Azores, through the
weekend.

SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston will begin affecting the Azores
tonight and continue into Saturday.  These swells are likely to
