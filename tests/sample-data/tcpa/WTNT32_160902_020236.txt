DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gaston was
located near latitude 38.3 North, longitude 36.0 West.  Gaston is
moving toward the east-northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h).  An
eastward or east-northeastward motion at a slower forward speed is
expected during the next day or so.  On the forecast track, the
center of Gaston will move near the western Azores on Friday, and
pass north of the central Azores Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours, and Gaston is expected to become a tropical storm
overnight.  The cyclone should become post-tropical on Saturday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the western Azores
on Friday and in the central Azores Friday night.

RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
1 to 3 inches, primarily over the western Azores, through the
weekend.

SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are beginning to affect the
Azores and will continue into Saturday.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.
