DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gaston was located
near latitude 38.4 North, longitude 35.4 West.  Gaston is moving
toward the east-northeast at a decreased forward speed near 16 mph
(25 km/h).  An eastward or east-northeastward motion is expected on
Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Gaston will move
near the western Azores today, and pass north of the central Azores
tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours,
and Gaston is expected to become a tropical storm today.  The
cyclone should become post-tropical on Saturday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175
miles (280 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).

later this morning and in the central Azores tonight.

RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
1 to 3 inches, primarily over the western Azores, through the
weekend.

SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are affecting the Azores and will
continue into Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
