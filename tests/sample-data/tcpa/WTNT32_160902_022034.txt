DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 39.6 North, longitude 30.4 West.  Gaston is
moving toward the east-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h), and a turn
toward the northeast is expected over the next day or so.  On the
forecast track, the center of Gaston will pass north of the central
Azores tonight.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and Gaston will
likely become a remnant low tomorrow.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
central Azores tonight.

RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce less than an inch of
additional rain across the Azores through Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are affecting the Azores and will
continue into Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.
