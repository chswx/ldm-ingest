DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gaston was
located near latitude 40.1 North, longitude 28.7 West.  Gaston is
moving toward the east-northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  An
east-northeastward and then northeastward motion with an increase
in forward speed is expected during the next 24 hours.  On the
forecast track, the center of Gaston will be moving way from the
Azores.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected, and Gaston is
forecast to become a remnant low Saturday morning.  The remnant low
should then dissipate by Sunday morning.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
to the southeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could still occur over portions of
the central Azores during the next few hours.

RAINFALL:  Gaston is expected to produce less than an inch of
additional rain across the Azores through Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Gaston are affecting the Azores and will
continue into Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.
