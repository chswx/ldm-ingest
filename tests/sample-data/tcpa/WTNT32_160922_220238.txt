DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Karl
was located near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 59.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h) and
this motion is expected to continue through Thursday.  A turn
toward the north is expected Thursday night or Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Data from the NOAA G-IV jet indicates that the circulation of Karl
is currently poorly organized.  However, conditions appear conducive
for slow strengthening during the next couple of days, and Karl
could regain tropical storm intensity on Thursday.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
