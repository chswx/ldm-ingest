DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 26.2 North, longitude 63.6 West. Karl is
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and is expected
to turn northward on Friday and northeastward on Saturday. On the
forecast track, the center of Karl is expected to pass near or to
the east of Bermuda Friday night and Saturday.

Reports from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (70 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast during the
next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the north of the center.  NOAA buoy 41049, located northeast of
the center, recently reported sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).

The minimum central pressure estimated from the the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda by Friday
evening.

RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches over Bermuda through Saturday and early Sunday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are already affecting Bermuda and
are expected to increase during the next couple of days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
