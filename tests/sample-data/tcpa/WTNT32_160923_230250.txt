Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Karl could
become a hurricane on Saturday.

from the center.  A few hours ago, NOAA buoy 41049 reported
sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a wind gust of 56 mph
(90 km/h).

evening.

RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches over Bermuda through Saturday and early Sunday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are already affecting Bermuda and
are expected to increase during the next couple of days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
