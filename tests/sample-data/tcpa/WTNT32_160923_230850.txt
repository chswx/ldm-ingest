DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 27.9 North, longitude 64.8 West. Karl is
moving toward the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A turn toward
the north is expected today, and a turn to the northeast is
anticipated by tonight or early Saturday. On the forecast track, the
center of Karl should pass near or to the east of Bermuda late
tonight or early Saturday.

Data from Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter planes indicate that
the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95
km/h) with higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is forecast
during the next 48 hours, and Karl could become a hurricane on
Saturday as it moves away from Bermuda.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
primarily to the north of the center.


The minimum central pressure estimated by reconnaissance aircraft
was 999 mb (29.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected on Bermuda tonight.

RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches over Bermuda through Saturday and early Sunday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are already affecting Bermuda and
are expected to increase during the next couple of days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
