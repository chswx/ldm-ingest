sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (105 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48
hours. Karl is forecast to reach hurricane intensity on Saturday and
then should become post-tropical on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter
data is 990 mb (29.23 inches).

RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 3 to 5 inches over Bermuda through Saturday.

TORNADOES:  Isolated tornadoes are possible on Bermuda overnight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are affecting Bermuda and are
expected to increase during the next couple of days.  These

conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
