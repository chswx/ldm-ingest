DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located by the Bermuda weather radar near latitude 31.2 North,
longitude 65.0 West. Karl is moving toward the north-northeast near
10 mph (16 km/h).  A turn toward the northeast and a faster forward
speed are expected later this morning, followed by a further
increase in forward speed by this afternoon. On the forecast track,
the center of Karl should pass near or southeast of Bermuda during
the next 12 hours.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next 36 hours, and Karl
is forecast to reach hurricane intensity later today and then
become post-tropical on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center. During the past hour, a wind gust to 41 mph (67
km/h) was reported on Bermuda.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).

will continue through this morning.  Hurricane conditions are
also possible on Bermuda later this morning.

RAINFALL:  Karl is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 3 to 5 inches over Bermuda through today.

TORNADOES:  Isolated tornadoes are possible on Bermuda this morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by Karl are affecting Bermuda and are
expected to increase during the next couple of days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
