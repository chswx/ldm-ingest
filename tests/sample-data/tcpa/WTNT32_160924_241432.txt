DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 32.8 North, longitude 62.7 West.  Karl is
moving toward the northeast near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A northeastward
motion at a much faster forward speed is expected during the next
36 hours.  On the forecast track, Karl will continue moving quickly
away from Bermuda today.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours,
and Karl is expected to reach hurricane intensity on Sunday and
remain at hurricane strength when it becomes a post-tropical
cyclone Sunday night.  Karl is forecast to be absorbed by an
extratropical cyclone early Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are possible on Bermuda
today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Karl will continue affecting Bermuda
through the weekend.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
