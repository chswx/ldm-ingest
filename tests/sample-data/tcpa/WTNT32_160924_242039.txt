At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 33.6 North, longitude 61.1 West.  Karl is
moving toward the east-northeast near 23 mph (37 km/h).  An
east-northeastward to northeastward motion at a faster forward
speed is expected tonight and Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours,
and Karl is expected to be at hurricane intensity when it becomes a
post-tropical cyclone on Sunday.  The post-tropical cyclone will be
absorbed by a large extratropical low Sunday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).

SURF:  Swells generated by Karl will continue affecting Bermuda
through tonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
