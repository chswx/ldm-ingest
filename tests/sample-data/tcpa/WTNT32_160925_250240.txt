At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Karl was
located near latitude 35.0 North, longitude 58.0 West. Karl is
moving toward the northeast near 29 mph (46 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue with an increase in forward speed through
Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours,
and Karl is expected to be at hurricane intensity when it becomes a
post-tropical cyclone on Sunday.  The post-tropical cyclone will be
absorbed by a large extratropical low Sunday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)

The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
