At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was

center of the depression will be passing north of the north coast
of western Cuba today, and moving farther into the southeastern Gulf
of Mexico by tonight.

Data from a NOAA reconnaissance aircraft indicate that the maximum
sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.  Some
strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and the
depression could become a tropical storm later today or tonight.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
