At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine
was located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 85.5 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn
toward the west-northwest is expected later tonight. A turn toward
northwest and north-northwest is expected Tuesday and Tuesday night,
followed by a turn toward the north-northeast on Wednesday.  On the
forecast track, the center of the depression will continue to move
slowly away from western Cuba, and move into the eastern Gulf of
Mexico over the next 48 hours.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and the
depression is expected to become a tropical storm on Tuesday.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches)
based on recent data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft.

RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 3 to 6 inches over western Cuba through Wednesday.
Isolated maximum storm-total amounts of 12 inches are possible over
western Cuba.  These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods
and mud slides.  Total rain accumulations of 3 to 7 inches are
possible over much of the Florida peninsula through Thursday.
Isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible along the west
coast of Florida from Naples to Steinhatchee.  This rainfall may
cause flooding and flash flooding.
