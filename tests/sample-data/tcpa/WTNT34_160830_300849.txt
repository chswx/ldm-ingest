DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was
located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 86.6 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A slow
west-northwestward motion is expected today.  A turn toward the
north-northwest is expected tonight, followed by a turn toward the
north-northeast on Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of
the depression will continue to move slowly away from western Cuba,
and move into the eastern Gulf of Mexico over the next 48 hours.

Reports from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the
maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and the
depression is expected to become a tropical storm today.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches)
based on dropsonde data from the NASA Global Hawk aircraft.


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches over western Cuba through Wednesday,
with maximum storm total amounts up to 12 inches.  These rains
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.  Storm
total rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches are possible over much of
the Florida peninsula through Friday morning, with isolated maximum
amounts of 15 inches possible.  This rainfall may cause flooding
and flash flooding.
