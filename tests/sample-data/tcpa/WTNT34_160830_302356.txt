A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Anclote River to Indian Pass

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* West of Indian Pass to the Walton/Bay County line

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests along the United States east coast from northern Florida
through the Carolinas should monitor the progress of this system.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine was
located near latitude 24.2 North, longitude 87.7 West.  The
depression is moving toward the west-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).
A turn toward the north-northwest is expected tonight, followed by a
turn toward the north-northeast on Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, the center will approach the northwest Florida coast in the
watch area on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and the
depression is expected to become a tropical storm tonight or early
Wednesday.

The minimum central pressure recently reported by a NOAA Hurricane
Hunter aircraft was 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible over portions of the
Hurricane Watch area by Thursday afternoon.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible over portions of the Tropical Storm Watch
area by Thursday afternoon.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is a
possibility of life-threatening inundation within the next 48 hours
along the Gulf coast of Florida from Aripeka to Indian Pass.  For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype National
Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic.  Persons located
within these areas should be prepared to take all necessary actions
to protect life and property from rising water.  Promptly follow
any instructions from local officials.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...
Indian Pass to Aripeka...2 to 4 feet
Aripeka to Bonita Beach...including Tampa Bay...1 to 2 feet

The Prototype National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning
Graphic is a depiction of areas that would qualify for inclusion
under a storm surge watch or warning currently under development by
the National Weather Service and planned for operational use in
2017.  This prototype graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 3 to 5 inches over western Cuba through Wednesday,
with maximum storm total amounts up to 20 inches.  These rains
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.  Storm
total rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches are possible over much of
the Florida peninsula through Friday morning, with isolated maximum
amounts of 15 inches possible.  This rainfall may cause flooding
and flash flooding.
