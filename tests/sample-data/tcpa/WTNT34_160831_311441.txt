DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Nine
was located near latitude 24.6 North, longitude 88.0 West.  The
depression is currently nearly stationary.  A north-northeastward
motion is expected to begin later today, and a turn toward the
northeast with increasing forward speed is expected on Thursday.  On
the forecast track, the center of the tropical cyclone will approach
the northwest Florida coast in the warning area on Thursday
afternoon.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and the
depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today, and
it could be near hurricane strength by the time landfall occurs.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area on Thursday afternoon.  Hurricane
conditions are possible over portions of the hurricane watch area
beginning Thursday afternoon.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the tropical storm watch area by early Friday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is a danger
of life-threatening inundation within the next 36 to 48 hours along
the Gulf coast of Florida from Aripeka to Indian Pass.  For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype National
Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic.  Persons located
within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life
and property from rising water.  Promptly follow any instructions,
including evacuation orders, from local officials.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Indian Pass to Ochlockonee River...2 to 4 feet
Ochlockonee River to Chassahowitzka...3 to 5 feet
Chassahowitzka to Aripeka...2 to 4 feet.
Aripeka to Bonita Beach...including Tampa Bay...1 to 2 feet

The Prototype National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning
Graphic is a depiction of areas that would qualify for inclusion
under a storm surge watch or warning currently under development by
the National Weather Service and planned for operational use in
2017.  This prototype graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

RAINFALL:  The depression is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches over western Cuba through today, with
maximum storm total amounts up to 20 inches.  These rains could
cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.  Storm total
rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches are possible over portions of
central and northern Florida through Friday, with isolated maximum
amounts of 15 inches possible.  Coastal areas of Georgia and the
Carolinas are expected to receive storm total rainfall of 4 to 7
inches, with local amounts of 10 inches possible through Saturday
morning.  These rains may cause flooding and flash flooding.

TORNADOES:  Isolated tornadoes are possible late tonight into
Thursday morning mainly across central Florida.  A few tornadoes are
possible Thursday afternoon into Thursday night over north Florida
and southeast Georgia.
