DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hermine was
located near latitude 29.7 North, longitude 84.3 West. Hermine is
moving toward the north-northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A general
motion toward the northeast is expected with an increase in forward
speed tonight through Friday night.  On the forecast track, the
center of Hermine should make landfall along the coast of
Apalachee Bay during the next few hours, then move across the
eastern Florida Panhandle into southeastern Georgia early Friday.
The center should then move near or over eastern South Carolina
Friday night and near or over eastern North Carolina on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible before landfall.  Weakening
will begin after the eye of Hermine crosses the coast.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km). The automated station at the Tyndall Tower south of
Apalachicola recently reported sustained winds of 61 mph (98 km/h)
and a wind gust of 79 mph (128 km/h) at an elevation of 115 ft (35
m).

The latest minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force
Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions should be spreading onto the coast in
the hurricane warning area at this time.  Preparations to protect
life and property should have been completed.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected to begin within the warning area along
the Atlantic coast on Friday, and spread northward through the
weekend.  Wind in the tropical storm warning area along the Gulf
coast of Florida should diminish later tonight.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is a danger
of life-threatening inundation within the next 12 to 24 hours along
the Gulf coast of Florida from Indian Pass to Longboat Key.  For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype National
Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic.  Persons located
within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life
and property from rising water.  Promptly follow any instructions,
including evacuation orders, from local officials.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Destin to Indian Pass...1 to 3 feet
Indian Pass to Ochlockonee River...4 to 7 feet
Ochlockonee River to Yankeetown...6 to 9 feet
Yankeetown to Aripeka...4 to 7 feet
Aripeka to Longboat Key...including Tampa Bay...2 to 4 feet
Longboat Key to Bonita Beach...1 to 3 feet
Florida-Georgia line to Tidewater of Virginia...1 to 3 feet

The Prototype National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning
Graphic is a depiction of areas that would qualify for inclusion
under a storm surge watch or warning currently under development by
the National Weather Service and planned for operational use in
2017.  This prototype graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce storm total rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches over the southeastern United States
from northwest Florida through southern and eastern Georgia into
South Carolina and eastern North Carolina, with possible isolated
maximum amounts of 15 inches. These rains may cause life-threatening
floods and flash floods. Heavy rain could reach the coastal
Mid-Atlantic states from Virginia to New Jersey beginning early
Saturday.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through tonight across
northern Florida and southern Georgia.  The tornado risk will spread
across the eastern Carolinas from Friday morning into Friday night.
