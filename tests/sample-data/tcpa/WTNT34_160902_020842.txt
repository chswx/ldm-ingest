DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hermine was
located inland near latitude 30.8 North, longitude 83.6 West.
Hermine is moving toward the north-northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h)
and this motion is expected to continue today and Saturday. On the
forecast track, the center of Hermine should continue to move
farther inland across southeastern Georgia today and into the
Carolinas tonight and Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast while Hermine
moves farther inland.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center. Valdosta, Georgia recently reported a wind gust of
53 mph (85 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin within the
warning area along the Atlantic coast later today, and spread
northward through the weekend.  Wind in the tropical storm warning
area along the Gulf coast of Florida should gradually diminish
today.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will continue to cause normally dry areas near the coast to be
flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is
a danger of life-threatening inundation within the next 12 to 24
hours along the Gulf coast of Florida from Indian Pass to Longboat
Key.  For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype
National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water.  Promptly follow any
instructions, including evacuation orders, from local officials.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Destin to Indian Pass...1 to 3 feet
Indian Pass to Ochlockonee River...4 to 7 feet
Ochlockonee River to Yankeetown...6 to 9 feet
Yankeetown to Aripeka...4 to 7 feet
Aripeka to Longboat Key...including Tampa Bay...2 to 4 feet
Longboat Key to Bonita Beach...1 to 3 feet
Florida-Georgia line to Tidewater of Virginia...1 to 3 feet

The Prototype National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning
Graphic is a depiction of areas that would qualify for inclusion
under a storm surge watch or warning currently under development by
the National Weather Service and planned for operational use in
2017.  This prototype graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce storm total rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches over the southeastern United States
from northwest Florida through southern and eastern Georgia into
South Carolina and eastern North Carolina, with possible isolated
maximum amounts of 15 inches. These rains may cause life-threatening
floods and flash floods. Heavy rain could reach the coastal
Mid-Atlantic states from Virginia to New Jersey beginning early
Saturday.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this morning across
northern Florida and southern Georgia.  The tornado risk will spread
across the eastern Carolinas later today.
