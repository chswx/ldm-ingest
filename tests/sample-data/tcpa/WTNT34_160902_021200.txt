DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hermine was
located inland inland over southern Georgia near latitude 31.2
North, longitude 82.9 West.  Hermine is moving toward the
north-northeast near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this motion is expected to
continue today and Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Hermine will continue to move across southeastern Georgia today,
move across the coastal Carolinas tonight and move offshore of the
North Carolina coast on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast while the center of
Hermine remains over land.  Some re-strengthening is expected after
the center moves offshore of the North Carolina coast on Saturday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.  Recently reported wind gusts include 46 mph (74
km/h) at Brunswick, Georgia, and St. Augustine, Florida.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue near the
center of Hermine this morning and spread northward within the
warning area along the Atlantic coast later today and tonight.
Winds in the tropical storm warning area along the Gulf coast of
Florida should gradually diminish today.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible in the watch area on Saturday and Sunday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
continue to cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Hazardous storm
surge will continue this morning along the Florida Gulf coast in
areas of onshore winds.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Aucilla River to Bonita Beach...including Tampa Bay...1 to 3 feet
Florida-Georgia line to Tidewater of Virginia...1 to 3 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce storm total rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches over the southeastern United States
from northwest Florida through southern and eastern Georgia into
South Carolina and eastern North Carolina, with possible isolated
maximum amounts of 15 inches. These rains may cause life-threatening
floods and flash floods. Heavy rain could reach the coastal
Mid-Atlantic states from Virginia to New Jersey beginning early
Saturday.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this morning across
northern Florida and southern Georgia.  The tornado risk will spread
across the eastern Carolinas later today.
