DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hermine was
inland over southeastern Georgia near latitude 31.9 North, longitude
82.0 West.  Hermine is moving toward the northeast near 18 mph (30
km/h) and this motion is expected to continue for the next 48 hours
with a gradual reduction in forward speed expected on Saturday.  On
the forecast track the center of Hermine will move across coastal
South Carolina later today, move over coastal North Carolina
tonight, and move offshore of the North Carolina coast on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is expected through Saturday morning.
Strengthening is forecast once the center of Hermine moves offshore
Saturday afternoon.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km),
mainly to the east of the center.  NOAA buoy 41008, located about
50 miles southeast of Savannah, Georgia, recently reported a
sustained wind of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a gust of 58 mph (94 km/h).
Marsh Island, Georgia, recently reported a sustained wind of 39 mph
(63 km/h) and a gust of 45 mph (72 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations
is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue near the
center of Hermine this afternoon and will spread northward within
the warning area along the Atlantic coast today through Saturday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area on Sunday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is the possibility
of life-threatening inundation during the next 48 hours at most
coastal locations between the North Carolina/Virginia border and
Bridgeport, Connecticut.  For a depiction of areas at risk, please
see the Prototype Storm Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays
areas that would qualify for inclusion under a storm surge watch or
warning currently under development by the National Weather Service
and planned for operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is
available at www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

NC/VA border to Bridgeport, Connecticut...2 to 4 feet


RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce storm total rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches with possible isolated maximum
amounts of 15 inches over the southeastern United States and
portions of the mid-Atlantic from southern and eastern Georgia into
South Carolina, eastern North Carolina, southeast Virginia, and the
lower Eastern Shore of Virginia and Maryland.  These rains may cause
life-threatening floods and flash floods.  Inflow bands south of
Hermine are expected to bring an additional 1 to 3 inches of
rainfall across portions of central and northern Florida through
today.  Heavy rainfall could reach the coastal areas of Delaware and
New Jersey beginning Saturday night.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible across coastal portions of
North and South Carolina today.
