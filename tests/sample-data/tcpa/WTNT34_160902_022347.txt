DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hermine was
located by NOAA Doppler radar and surface observations inland over
eastern South Carolina near latitude 33.5 North, longitude 79.5
West.  Hermine is moving toward the northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h)
and this motion is expected to continue through Sunday with a
gradual decrease in forward speed during that time.  On the forecast
track, the center of Hermine will move across coastal South Carolina
this evening, move across coastal North Carolina tonight and
Saturday morning, and move offshore of the North Carolina coast by
Saturday afternoon.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected tonight and early
Saturday while the center of Hermine remains over land.
Strengthening is forecast after the center moves offshore, and
Hermine could be near hurricane intensity by late Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km),
mainly to the south and east of the center.  NOAA buoy 41004,
located in the Atlantic southeast of Charleston, recently reported
sustained winds of 49 mph (78 km/h) and a wind gust of 60 mph (97
km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations
is 995 mb (29.38 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread northward
within the warning area along the Atlantic coast through Saturday
night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area by
late Sunday or Sunday night.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is a danger of
life-threatening inundation during the next 24 hours in the Hampton
Roads area.  Persons within this area should take all necessary
actions to protect life and property from rising water.  Promptly
follow all instructions, including evacuation orders, from local
officials.  There is also the possibility of life-threatening
inundation during the next 48 hours at most coastal locations
between the North Carolina/Virginia border and Bridgeport,
Connecticut.

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype Storm
Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays areas that would qualify
for inclusion under a storm surge watch or warning currently under
development by the National Weather Service and planned for
operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Hampton Roads area...3 to 5 feet
Elsewhere from the NC/VA border to Bridgeport, CT...2 to 4 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce storm total rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches with possible isolated maximum
amounts of 15 inches over the southeastern United States and
portions of the lower mid Atlantic from southern and eastern Georgia
into South Carolina and eastern North Carolina.  Across southeastern
Virginia and the lower Eastern Shore of Virginia and Maryland, storm
total rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches are expected. These rains
may cause life-threatening floods and flash floods.  Rainbands south
of Hermine are expected to bring an additional 1 to 3 inches of
rainfall across portions of central and northern Florida. Heavy
rainfall could reach the coastal areas of Delaware and New Jersey
beginning Saturday night.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible this evening over coastal
areas of North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina.
