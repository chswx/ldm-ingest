DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hermine was
located inland over southern North Carolina near latitude 34.1
North, longitude 78.4 West. Hermine is moving toward the northeast
near 22 mph (35 km/h) and this general motion is expected to
continue with some decrease in forward speed through Saturday
night. A gradual turn toward the north is expected on Sunday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Hermine should move across eastern
North Carolina tonight and emerge over the Atlantic on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast after the center moves offshore, and
Hermine could be near hurricane intensity by late Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
mainly to the south and east of the center.  NOAA buoy 41013
recently reported sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) and a wind
gust of 51 mph (83 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread northward
within the warning area along the Atlantic coast through Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area by
late Sunday or Sunday night.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is a danger of
life-threatening inundation during the next 24 hours in the Hampton
Roads area.  Persons within this area should take all necessary
actions to protect life and property from rising water.  Promptly
follow all instructions, including evacuation orders, from local
officials.  There is also the possibility of life-threatening
inundation during the next 48 hours at most coastal locations
between the North Carolina/Virginia border and Bridgeport,
Connecticut.

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype Storm
Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays areas that would qualify
for inclusion under a storm surge watch or warning currently under
development by the National Weather Service and planned for
operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

North Carolina coast...1 to 3 feet
Hampton Roads area...3 to 5 feet
Elsewhere from the NC/VA border to Bridgeport, CT...2 to 4 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches from east-central to eastern North
Carolina, far southeast Virginia into the coastal sections of the
Delmarva peninsula and coastal southern New Jersey through Sunday.
These rains may cause life-threatening floods and flash floods.
Heavy rains may affect coastal northern New Jersey and Long Island
Sunday night into early Monday.  Rainbands well to the south of
Hermine may produce additional isolated rainfall totals of 3 to 5
inches over north Florida tonight into early Saturday.

TORNADOES:  A tornado or two remains possible overnight across the
North Carolina Outer Banks.
