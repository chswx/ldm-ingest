DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hermine was
located near latitude 35.4 North, longitude 76.5 West. Hermine is
moving toward the east-northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this
general motion with a decrease in forward speed is forecast to
continue today.  A gradual turn toward the north is expected on
Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Hermine will emerge
over the Atlantic later today.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast after the center moves over water,
and Hermine could be near hurricane intensity by Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
mainly to the south and east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread northward
within the warning area along the Atlantic coast through Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area by
late Sunday or Sunday night.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is a danger of
life-threatening inundation during the next 24 hours in the Hampton
Roads area.  Persons within this area should take all necessary
actions to protect life and property from rising water.  Promptly
follow all instructions, including evacuation orders, from local
officials.  There is also the possibility of life-threatening
inundation during the next 48 hours at most coastal locations
between the North Carolina/Virginia border and Bridgeport,
Connecticut.

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype Storm
Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays areas that would qualify
for inclusion under a storm surge watch or warning currently under
development by the National Weather Service and planned for
operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

North Carolina coast...1 to 3 feet
Hampton Roads area...3 to 5 feet
Elsewhere from the NC/VA border to Bridgeport, CT...2 to 4 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 7 inches over far southeastern Virginia and
the Atlantic coastal portion of Maryland through Monday morning.
Hermine is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 1 to
4 inches over southern Delaware, southern and eastern New Jersey,
and Long Island through Monday morning. Moisture wrapping around
Hermine and trailing back to the south will produce an additional 1
to 3 inches or rain over parts of North Carolina and northern
Florida. This rainfall may contribute to flooding in some areas.
