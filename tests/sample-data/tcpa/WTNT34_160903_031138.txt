DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hermine was
located by NOAA Doppler radar and surface observations near the
northern Outer Banks of North Carolina near latitude 35.9 North,
longitude 75.6 West.  Hermine is moving toward the east-northeast
near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this general motion with a decrease in
forward speed is forecast to continue today.  A gradual turn toward
the north is expected on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center
of Hermine will emerge over the Atlantic very soon, and then slow
down and meander offshore of the Delmarva Peninsula tonight and
Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast after the center moves over water,
and Hermine could be near hurricane intensity by Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
mainly to the south and east of the center.  Elizabeth City, North
Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 32 mph (52 km/h) and
a wind gust of 52 mph (83 km/h).  A National Ocean Service station
at Rappahannock Light, Virginia, recently reported a sustained wind
of 40 mph (64 km/h), and a wind gust of 45 mph (72 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations
is 995 mb (29.38 inches).  A National Ocean Service station at
Oregon Inlet Marina, North Carolina, recently reported a pressure
of 996.6 mb (29.41 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread northward
within the warning area along the Atlantic coast through Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area by
late Sunday or Sunday night.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  There is a danger of
life-threatening inundation during the next 12 hours in the Hampton
Roads area, where water levels are rapidly rising with the
approach of the next high tide.  Persons within this area should
take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising
water. Promptly follow all instructions, including evacuation
orders, from local officials. There is also the possibility of
life-threatening inundation during the next 48 hours at most coastal
locations between the North Carolina/Virginia border and Bridgeport,
Connecticut.

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype Storm
Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays areas that would qualify
for inclusion under a storm surge watch or warning currently under
development by the National Weather Service and planned for
operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

North Carolina coast...1 to 3 feet
Hampton Roads area...3 to 5 feet
Elsewhere from the NC/VA border to Bridgeport, CT...2 to 4 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 7 inches over far southeastern Virginia and
the Atlantic coastal portion of Maryland through Monday morning.
Hermine is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 1 to
4 inches over southern Delaware, southern and eastern New Jersey,
and Long Island through Monday morning. Moisture wrapping around
Hermine and trailing back to the south will produce an additional 1
to 3 inches or rain over parts of North Carolina and northern
Florida. This rainfall may contribute to flooding in some areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by Hermine will affect much of the U.S.
mid-Atlantic coast through the weekend.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and
significant beach erosion.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
