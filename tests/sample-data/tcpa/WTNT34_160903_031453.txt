DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
Satellite imagery indicates that Hermine has lost tropical
characteristics, and is now a post-tropical cyclone.  At 1100 AM EDT
(1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Hermine was located
just offshore of the North Carolina Outer Banks near latitude 36.1
North, longitude 75.2 West.  Hermine is moving toward the east-
northeast near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A turn toward the northeast and a
decrease in forward speed are expected by tonight, followed by a
slow northward motion through early Monday. On the forecast track,
the center of Hermine will move away from the North Carolina coast
and meander offshore of the Delmarva Peninsula Sunday night and
early Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours,
and Hermine is expected to be near hurricane intensity on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.  A National Ocean Service station at the Duck Pier
in North Carolina recently reported a sustained wind of 58 mph (94
km/h) and a wind gust of 73 mph (117 km/h).  Elizabeth City, North
Carolina, recently reported a sustained wind of 44 mph (70 km/h) and
a wind gust of 55 mph (89 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread northward
within the warning area along the Atlantic coast through Sunday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area by late
Sunday or Sunday night.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.  There is a danger of life-threatening inundation during the
next few hours in the Hampton Roads area, and in the next 36 hours
from Chincoteague, Virginia, to Sandy Hook, New Jersey.  Persons
within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life
and property from rising water.  Promptly follow all instructions,
including evacuation orders, from local officials.  There is also
the possibility of life-threatening inundation during the next 48
hours at many coastal locations between Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and
Bridgeport, Connecticut.

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype Storm
Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays areas that would qualify
for inclusion under a storm surge watch or warning currently under
development by the National Weather Service and planned for
operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

North Carolina coast...1 to 3 feet
Hampton Roads area...3 to 5 feet
Chincoteague, VA to Sandy Hook, NJ...3 to 5 feet
Sandy Hook, NJ to Bridgeport, CT...2 to 4 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 7 inches over far southeastern Virginia and
the Atlantic coastal portion of Maryland through Monday morning.
Hermine is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 1 to
4 inches over southern Delaware, southern and eastern New Jersey,
and Long Island through Monday morning.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will affect the U.S. east
coast from the mid-Atlantic states and expand northward along the
coast of southern New England through the weekend.  These waves are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,
and significant beach erosion.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
