DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 36.4 North, longitude 71.4 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near
13 mph (20 km/h).  A turn toward the northeast and the north with a
decrease in forward speed is expected later today, followed by a
slow northward to northwestward motion through Monday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Hermine will meander slowly offshore
of the mid-Atlantic coast for the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected today.
After that, the cyclone is forecast to intensify to hurricane force
late tonight and on Monday.

Hermine has a large wind field.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend
outward up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread northward
within the warning area along the Atlantic coast through Monday,
and there may be multiple occurrences of tropical storm conditions
along portions of the mid-Atlantic coast in the warning area during
the next couple of days. Tropical storm conditions are possible in
the watch area by Monday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.  There is a danger of life-threatening inundation through
tonight in the Hampton Roads area, and in the next 36 hours from
Chincoteague, Virginia, to Sandy Hook, New Jersey.  Persons within
these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and
property from rising water.  Promptly follow all instructions,
including evacuation orders, from local officials.  There is also
the possibility of life-threatening inundation during the next 48
hours at many coastal locations between Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and
Bridgeport, Connecticut.

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype Storm
Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays areas that would qualify
for inclusion under a storm surge watch or warning currently under
development by the National Weather Service and planned for
operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

North Carolina sounds...1 to 3 feet
Hampton Roads area...2 to 4 feet
Chincoteague, VA to Sandy Hook, NJ...3 to 5 feet
Sandy Hook, NJ to Bridgeport, CT...2 to 4 feet

RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall associated with Hermine will mainly remain
offshore through Monday/Labor Day. However, isolated maximum
rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are still possible along the
immediate coastline of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast and up into
southeast New England.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will affect the U.S. east
coast from the mid-Atlantic states and expand northward along the
coast of southern New England through Monday.  These waves are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,
and significant beach erosion.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
