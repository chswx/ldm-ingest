DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 37.2 North, longitude 69.1 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 5
mph (7 km/h).  A turn toward the north with a decrease in forward
speed is expected later today, followed by a slow
north-northwestward motion through Monday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Hermine will meander slowly offshore of the
mid-Atlantic coast for the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Hermine should remain at or near hurricane strength for the
next day or so, and begin to gradually weaken by Monday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will spread northward within the
warning area along the Atlantic coast through Monday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.  There is a possibility of life-threatening inundation during
the next 48 hours on the North Shore of Long Island east of
Flushing and on the south shore of Long Island east of Rockaway
Inlet.

For a depiction of areas at risk, please see the Prototype Storm
Surge Watch/Warning graphic, which displays areas that would qualify
for inclusion under a storm surge watch or warning currently under
development by the National Weather Service and planned for
operational use in 2017.  The Prototype Graphic is available at
www.hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?wsurge

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Rehoboth Beach, DE to Montauk Point, NY including the North Shore of
Long Island east of Flushing...1 to 3 feet

RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall associated with Hermine will remain mainly
offshore through Wednesday.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are
possible across far southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod
and the offshore islands.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will affect the U.S. east
coast from the mid-Atlantic states and expand northward along the
coast of southern New England through Monday.  These waves are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,
and significant beach erosion.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
