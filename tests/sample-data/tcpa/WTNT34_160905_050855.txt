DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 37.7 North, longitude 68.3 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is drifting toward the north near 3 mph
(6 km/h).  A gradual turn toward the north-northwest and northwest
is expected to occur this afternoon and tonight.  A northeastward
motion is expected to begin by Tuesday night.  On the forecast
track, the center of Hermine will meander slowly offshore of the
mid-Atlantic coast for the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Hermine should remain near hurricane strength through
tonight. Gradual weakening is forecast to begin by Tuesday morning.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center. A ship located about 180 miles north of the center
recently reported a sustained wind of 52 mph (83 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin over portions
of the warning area by this afternoon.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson
Harbor...1 to 2 feet

RAINFALL:  Heavy rainfall associated with Hermine will remain mainly
offshore through Wednesday.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are
possible across far southeastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod
and the offshore islands.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will affect the U.S. east
coast from the mid-Atlantic states and expand northward along the
coast of southern New England through tonight.  These waves are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,
and significant beach erosion.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
