DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 39.1 North, longitude 69.2 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northwest near 6 mph
(9 km/h), and a turn toward the north with decreasing forward speed
is expected over the next day or two.  On the forecast track, the
center of Hermine will meander slowly offshore of the New England
coast through Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Hermine should remain near hurricane strength today.  A
gradual weakening trend is forecast to begin on Tuesday morning.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.  Nantucket Island recently reported a sustained
wind of 39 mph (63 km/h) with a gust to 52 mph (83 km/h).

The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force
reconnaissance aircraft observations is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over
portions of the warning area later today and tonight.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson
Harbor...1 to 2 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine will produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 2
inches across eastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and the
offshore islands, through Wednesday.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will affect the U.S. east
coast from the mid-Atlantic states through New England.  These waves
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions, and significant beach erosion.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.
