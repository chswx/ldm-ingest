DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 39.3 North, longitude 70.3 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west-northwest near 9
mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is expected to continue
overnight, followed by a slow and erratic motion on Tuesday and
Wednesday. On the forecast track, the center of Hermine will meander
slowly offshore of the New England coast into Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  A weakening trend is forecast to begin tonight.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.  Sustained winds of 32 mph (52 km/h) with gusts of
48 mph (78 km/h) have been observed in the last couple of hours at
Nantucket, Massachusetts.

The minimum central pressure measured by an Air Force
reconnaissance aircraft is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over
portions of the warning area tonight and Tuesday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson
Harbor...1 to 2 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine will produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 2
inches across eastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and the
offshore islands, through Wednesday.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will affect the U.S. east
coast from the mid-Atlantic states through New England.  These waves
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions, and significant beach erosion.  Please consult products
from your local weather office.
