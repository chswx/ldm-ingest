DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 39.6 North, longitude 71.3 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west-northwest near
9 mph (15 km/h).  A decrease in forward speed is expected later
today, and Hermine will likely become nearly stationary by tonight.
A turn toward the northeast is forecast to occur on Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.  The Montauk Point buoy south of Long Island
recently reported a 39 mph (63 km/h) sustained wind and a gust to
54 mph (86 km/h).

The minimum central pressure recently observed from an Air Force
reconnaissance aircraft is 995 mb (29.39 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over
portions of the warning area today.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson
Harbor...1 to 2 feet

RAINFALL:  Hermine will produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 2
inches across eastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod and the
offshore islands, through Wednesday.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will continue to affect the
U.S. east coast from the mid-Atlantic states through New England
for another couple of days. These waves are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and significant
beach erosion.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
