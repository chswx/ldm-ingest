DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 39.6 North, longitude 71.6 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west near 8 mph (13
km/h). A decrease in forward speed is expected later today, and
Hermine will likely become nearly stationary by tonight. A turn
toward the northeast is forecast to occur on Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center. The Montauk Point buoy south of eastern Long Island
recently reported a 38-mph (61 km/h) sustained wind and a gust to
47 mph (76 km/h).  The buoy south of Islip in Long Island recently
reported a 36-mph (57 km/h) sustained wind and a gust to 45 mph (72
km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
warning area today.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson
Harbor...1 to 2 feet.

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce additional light rainfall
amounts not exceeding 1 inch along the mid-Atlantic and southern New
England coastline from New Jersey to eastern Long Island to
southeastern Massachusetts.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will continue to affect the
U.S. east coast from the mid-Atlantic states through New England
for another couple of days. These waves are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and significant
beach erosion.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
