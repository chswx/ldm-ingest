DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 39.5 North, longitude 71.9 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west near 3 mph (6
km/h).  A slow and erratic motion is expected for the rest of today
and tonight, followed by a slow motion toward the northeast on
Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Additional gradual weakening is likely during the
next couple of days, and Hermine may weaken below tropical storm
force by Thursday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the
warning area today.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a storm surge and the tide will
cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  Along the immediate
coastline, the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous
waves.

The water could reach the following heights above ground if the
peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson
Harbor...1 to 2 feet.

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce additional light rainfall
amounts not exceeding 1 inch along the mid-Atlantic and southern New
England coastline from New Jersey to eastern Long Island to
southeastern Massachusetts.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will continue to affect the
U.S. East Coast from the mid-Atlantic states through New England
for another couple of days. These waves are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and significant
beach erosion.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
