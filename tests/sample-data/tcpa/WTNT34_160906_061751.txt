DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Hermine was located near latitude 39.4 North, longitude 72.3 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the west near 7 mph
(11 km/h). A decrease in forward speed is expected for the rest of
today, followed by a slow and erratic motion tonight and a
motion toward the northeast on Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Additional gradual weakening is likely during the
next couple of days, and Hermine may weaken below tropical storm
force by Thursday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Locally gusty winds over portions of Long Island and
southeastern New England should diminish during the next 24 hours.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels remain elevated along the coast of Long
Island, but they should subside during the next day or so as
Hermine exits the area.

RAINFALL:  Hermine is expected to produce additional light rainfall
amounts not exceeding 1 inch along the mid-Atlantic and southern New
England coastlines from New Jersey to eastern Long Island to
southeastern Massachusetts.

SURF:  Large waves generated by Hermine will continue to affect the
U.S. east coast from the mid-Atlantic states through New England
for another couple of days. These waves are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and significant
beach erosion.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
