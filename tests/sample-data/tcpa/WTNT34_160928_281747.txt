DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Matthew was
located near latitude 13.6 North, longitude 61.3 West. Matthew is
moving toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h). A westward motion with
some decrease in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Matthew will move away
from the Windward Islands through this evening, and be over the
eastern and central Caribbean Sea through Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days,
and Matthew could become a hurricane by Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
primarily to the northeast of the center.  Winds of 39 mph (63
km/h) were recently reported on Barbados, and a weather station on
Martinique recently observed sustained winds of 47 mph (75 km/h)
with gusts to 60 mph (97 km/h).

The minimum central pressure estimated from recent reconnaissance
data is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue to spread over
the southern Leeward Islands and northern Windward Islands within
the warning area this afternoon and continue into this evening.

RAINFALL:  Matthew is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches across the Windward Islands and
southern portions of the Leeward Islands through Thursday.  These
rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.
Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are expected farther to the north
into the northern Leeward Islands, including the United States and
British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
