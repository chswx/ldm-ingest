DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Matthew was
located near latitude 13.9 North, longitude 62.4 West. Matthew's
forward speed has decreased, and the storm is now moving toward the
west near 15 mph (24 km/h). A westward motion with some additional
decrease in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Matthew will continue to
move away from the Windward Islands this evening, and be over the
eastern and central Caribbean Sea through Friday.

Data from a reconnaissance plane indicate that the maximum sustained
winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected during the next couple of days, and
Matthew is forecast to become a hurricane by Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
primarily to the northeast of the center.  A wind gust to 89 mph
(143 km/h) was reported at St. Pierre, Martinique within the past
few hours.

The minimum central pressure just estimated by an Air Force
reconnaissance aircraft was 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

over the southern Leeward Islands and northern Windward Islands
within the warning area.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in
Bonaire, Curacao, and Aruba, beginning late Thursday.

RAINFALL:  Matthew is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches across the Windward Islands and
southern portions of the Leeward Islands through Thursday.  These

Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are expected farther to the north
