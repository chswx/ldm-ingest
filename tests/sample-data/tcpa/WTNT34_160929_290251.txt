DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Matthew was
located by a reconnaissance plane near latitude 13.9 North,
longitude 63.1 West. Matthew is moving toward the west near 15 mph
(24 km/h), and this motion with some decrease in forward speed
is expected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast track,
the center of Matthew will continue to move away from the Windward
Islands tonight, and be over the eastern and central Caribbean Sea
through Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is expected during the next couple of days,
and Matthew is forecast to become a hurricane by Thursday night or
Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
primarily to the north and east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure measured by an Air Force
reconnaissance plane was 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue through this evening
over the southern Leeward Islands and northern Windward Islands
within the warning area. These condition should begin to subside
during the next several hours.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in Bonaire, Curacao, and Aruba beginning late Thursday.

RAINFALL:  Matthew is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches across the Windward Islands and
southern portions of the Leeward Islands through Thursday.  These
rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.
Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches are expected farther to the north
into the northern Leeward Islands, including the United States and
British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3
