At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Matthew was
located near latitude 13.9 North, longitude 64.0 West. Matthew is
moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this motion with
some decrease in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Matthew will continue to
move away from the Windward Islands tonight, and be over the eastern
and central Caribbean Sea through Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is expected during the next couple of days,
and Matthew is forecast to become a hurricane by Thursday night or
Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
primarily to the north and east of the center.

The minimum central pressure measured by an Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter aircraft was 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

RAINFALL:  Matthew is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches across the Windward Islands and
southern portions of the Leeward Islands through Thursday.  These
