motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected during the
next couple of days.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate
that maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected during the next 48 hours,
and Matthew is forecast to become a hurricane later today or
tonight.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure from reconnaissance
aircraft data is 996 mb (29.42 inches).

through Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao,
