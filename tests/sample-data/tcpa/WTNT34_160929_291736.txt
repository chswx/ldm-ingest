DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Matthew was
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 67.0 West.  Matthew is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h), and a general westward
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected during the
next couple of days.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (110
km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected during
the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force-winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km) from the center.  NOAA buoy 42059 has recently
reported sustained winds of 47 mph (76 km/h) with a gust to
54 mph (86 km/h).

The latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft was 993 mb (29.32 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible in Bonaire, Curacao,
and Aruba beginning late today.

RAINFALL: Rainfall associated with Matthew will begin to diminish
across the Lesser Antilles this afternoon, with additional amounts
of an inch or less expected.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with
isolated higher amounts are expected over Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao
through Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao,
Venezuela, and Colombia during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
