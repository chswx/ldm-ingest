DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Matthew was
located near latitude 14.1 North, longitude 67.8 West.  Matthew is
moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A westward to
west-southwestward motion with some decrease in forward speed
is expected during the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual strengthening is expected during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km). NOAA buoy 42059 has recently reported sustained
winds of 59 mph (94 km/h) with a gust to 63 mph (101 km/h).

possible over portions of the watch in Colombia beginning Friday.

RAINFALL: Rainfall associated with Matthew will continue to diminish
across the Lesser Antilles this evening.  Isolated additional

Windward Islands.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated

Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao,
