At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Matthew was
located by an Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane near latitude 14.1
North, longitude 68.8 West. Matthew is moving toward the west near
14 mph (22 km/h), and this general motion with a decrease in
forward sped is forecast during the next day or two.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next
48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) to
the north of the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend
outward up to 185 miles (295 km) to the north of the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated by an Air Force
reconnaissance plane was 983 mb (29.03 inches).

and Aruba tonight and Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible over portions of the watch area in Colombia beginning

RAINFALL: Rainfall associated with Matthew will continue to diminish
across the southern Windward Islands this evening.  Rainfall totals

Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao through Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao,
