Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155
km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast
during the next 48 hours, and Matthew could become a major hurricane
later today or tonight.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the

miles (295 km).
