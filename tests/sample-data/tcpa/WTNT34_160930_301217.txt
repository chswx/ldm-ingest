DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Matthew was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near
latitude 13.8 North, longitude 70.3 West.  Matthew is moving toward
the west-southwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward the west is
expected later today, and this westward motion with a decrease in
forward speed are forecast through Saturday.  A turn toward the
northwest is expected Saturday night or Sunday.

Data from the aircraft indicate that maximum sustained winds have
increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional
strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Matthew
could become a major hurricane later today or tonight.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).

The latest minimum central pressure reported by the aircraft was
971 mb (28.67 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible in Aruba this
morning.  Tropical storm conditions are possible over portions
of the watch area in Colombia beginning later today.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected over Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao through
Saturday.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected along the coast of Colombia from the Venezuelan
border to Riohacha.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with isolated
higher amounts are expected along the coast of Venezuela from Coro
to the Colombian border.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao,
Venezuela, and Colombia during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
