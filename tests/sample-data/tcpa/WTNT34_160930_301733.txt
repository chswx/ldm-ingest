DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Matthew was located
near latitude 13.6 North, longitude 71.3 West.  Matthew is moving
toward the west-southwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A westward motion
at a slower forward speed is expected later today and tonight.  A
turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by Saturday night,
followed by a turn toward the northwest by early Sunday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Matthew will pass north of the Guajira
Peninsula this afternoon and tonight and remain over the central
Caribbean Sea through early Sunday.

Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum
sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Matthew is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-
Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is forecast
during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).

The latest minimum central pressure estimated from the aircraft
is 960 mb (28.35 inches).

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected over Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao through

amounts are expected along the coast of Colombia from the Venezuelan
border to Riohacha.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with isolated

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao,
