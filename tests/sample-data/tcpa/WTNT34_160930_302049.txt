DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Matthew was located
near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 71.6 West.  Matthew is moving
toward the west-southwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A westward motion
at a slower forward speed is expected tonight and Saturday.  A turn
toward the west-northwest is forecast by Saturday night, followed by
a turn toward the northwest on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Matthew will move north of the Guajira Peninsula this
tonight, move across the central Caribbean Sea on Saturday, and be
near Jamaica on Sunday.

Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum
sustained winds have increased to near 140 mph (220 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Matthew is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-
Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening is
possible tonight, and some fluctuations in intensity are possible
Saturday and Sunday.  Matthew is expected to remain a powerful
hurricane through Sunday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).

The latest minimum central pressure based on data from the NOAA
aircraft is 949 mb (28.03 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
warning area in Colombia through tonight.  Hurricane conditions are
possible on Jamaica on Monday, with tropical storm conditions
possible by late Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible
in the watch area in Haiti by late Sunday.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected over Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao through
Saturday.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected along the coast of Colombia from the Venezuelan
border to Riohacha.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with isolated
higher amounts are expected along the coast of Venezuela from Coro
to the Colombian border.

Rainfall totals of 10 to 15 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
25 inches are expected across Jamaica and southern and southwestern
Haiti.  These rains may produce life-threatening flash flooding and
mud slides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Aruba, Bonaire,
Curacao, Venezuela, and Colombia during the next few days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
