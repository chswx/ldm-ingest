DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the well-defined eye of Hurricane Matthew
was located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 72.0 West.  Matthew
is moving south of due west near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A westward motion
at a slower forward speed is expected tonight and Saturday.  A turn
toward the west-northwest is forecast by Saturday night, followed by
a turn toward the northwest on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Matthew will move north of the Guajira Peninsula tonight,
move across the central Caribbean Sea on Saturday, and be near
Jamaica late on Sunday.

Data from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that
maximum sustained winds have increased to near 150 mph (240 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Matthew is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-
Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are
possible this weekend, but Matthew is expected to remain a
powerful hurricane through Sunday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km) primarily to the north of the center.

The latest minimum central pressure just reported by an Air Force
reconnaissance aircraft was 945 mb (27.90 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in
portions of the warning area in Colombia through tonight.  Hurricane
conditions are possible on Jamaica on Monday, with tropical storm
conditions possible by late Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area in Haiti by late Sunday.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected over Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao through
Saturday.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected along the coast of Colombia from the Venezuelan
border to Riohacha.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with isolated
higher amounts are expected along the coast of Venezuela from Coro
to the Colombian border.

Rainfall totals of 10 to 15 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
25 inches are expected across Jamaica and southern and southwestern
Haiti.  These rains may produce life-threatening flash flooding and
mud slides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Aruba, Bonaire,
Curacao, Venezuela, and Colombia during the next few days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
