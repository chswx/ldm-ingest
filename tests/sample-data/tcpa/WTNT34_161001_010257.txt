DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Matthew was located
near latitude 13.3 North, longitude 72.3 West.  Matthew is moving
just south of due west near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward the
west-northwest is forecast on Saturday, followed by a turn toward
the northwest on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Matthew will move north of the Guajira Peninsula tonight, move
across the central Caribbean Sea on Saturday, and be approaching
Jamaica late Sunday.

Data from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter plane indicate that
the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 160 mph (260
km/h) with higher gusts.  Matthew is a category 5 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Some fluctuations in intensity
are possible this weekend, but Matthew is expected to remain a
powerful hurricane through Sunday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).

The minimum central pressure estimated by a reconnaissance aircraft
was 941 mb (27.79 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in
portions of the warning area in Colombia overnight.  Hurricane
conditions are possible on Jamaica on Monday, with tropical storm
conditions possible by late Sunday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area in Haiti by late Sunday.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected over Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao through
Saturday.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected along the coast of Colombia from the Venezuelan
border to Riohacha.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with isolated
higher amounts are expected along the coast of Venezuela from Coro
to the Colombian border.

Rainfall totals of 10 to 15 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
25 inches are expected across Jamaica and southern and southwestern
Haiti.  These rains may produce life-threatening flash flooding and
mud slides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Aruba, Bonaire,
Curacao, Venezuela, and Colombia during the next few days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
