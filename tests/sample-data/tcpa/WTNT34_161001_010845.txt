------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Matthew was
located near latitude 13.3 North, longitude 72.8 West. Matthew is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the
west-northwest is forecast later today, followed by a turn toward
the north-northwest on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Matthew will move away from the Guajira Peninsula this morning, move
across the central Caribbean Sea today, and be approaching Jamaica
late Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Matthew is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible
this weekend, but Matthew is expected to remain a powerful hurricane
through Sunday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 942 mb (27.82 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in
portions of the warning area in Colombia for the next few hours.
Hurricane conditions are possible on Jamaica on Monday, with
tropical storm conditions possible by late Sunday.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the watch area in Haiti by late
Sunday.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected over Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao through today.
Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher amounts are

amounts are expected along the coast of Venezuela from Coro to the
Colombian border.

Rainfall totals of 10 to 15 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
25 inches are expected across Jamaica and southern and southwestern

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Aruba, Bonaire,
Curacao, Venezuela, Colombia, and eastern Cuba during the next few
