DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Matthew was
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near
latitude 13.4 North, longitude 73.1 West.  Matthew is moving toward
the west near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A turn toward the west-northwest is
forecast later today, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest
on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Matthew will
continue to move away from the Guajira Peninsula this morning, move
across the central Caribbean Sea today and Sunday, and approach
Jamaica Sunday night and Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Matthew is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible
this weekend, but Matthew is expected to remain a powerful hurricane
through Monday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure based on data from the
aircraft is 947 mb (27.96 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in
portions of the warning area in Colombia for the next few hours.
Hurricane conditions are possible on Jamaica on Monday, with
tropical storm conditions possible by late Sunday.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the watch area in Haiti by late
Sunday.

RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected over Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao through today.
Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher amounts are
expected along the coast of Colombia from the Venezuelan border to
Riohacha.  Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches with isolated higher
amounts are expected along the coast of Venezuela from Coro to the
Colombian border.

Rainfall totals of 10 to 15 inches with isolated maximum amounts of
25 inches are expected across Jamaica and southern and southwestern
Haiti.  These rains may produce life-threatening flash flooding and
mud slides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew are expected to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Aruba, Bonaire,
Curacao, Venezuela, Colombia, and eastern Cuba during the next few
days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
