DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of the eye of Hurricane Matthew
was located by an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft near
latitude 14.5 North, longitude 75.0 West.  Matthew is moving toward
the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h). A turn toward the north-northwest
is expected tonight, followed by a turn toward the north on Monday.
On the forecast track, the center of Matthew will approach Jamaica
and southwestern Haiti on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Matthew is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible
during the next couple of days, but Matthew is expected to remain a
powerful hurricane into Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).  NOAA data buoy 42058, in the central Caribbean Sea,
recently reported a wind gust to 62 mph (100 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure recently measured by the
reconnaissance aircraft was 945 mb (27.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach Jamaica and Haiti
on Monday, and eastern Cuba Monday night.  Tropical storm conditions
are expected to first reach Jamaica and Haiti tonight, and eastern
Cuba early Monday, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.  Preparations to protect life and property should be
rushed to completion.  Tropical storm conditions are expected along
the southern coast of the Dominican Republic within the warning area
by tonight.

Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch areas by
late Tuesday with tropical storm conditions possible by early
Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are also possible in the
tropical storm watch area in the Dominican Republic by late
Monday.

RAINFALL: Matthew is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 15 to 25 inches in southern Haiti and the southwestern portion of
the Dominican Republic, with possible isolated amounts of 40 inches.
Across eastern Cuba and western Haiti, total rain accumulations of 8
to 12 inches are expected, with possible isolated maximum amounts of
20 inches.  Across eastern Jamaica, total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches
is expected, with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible.
This rainfall will likely produce life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

Matthew is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 8 to 12
inches over the southeastern Bahamas, with isolated maximum amounts
of 15 inches.  Matthew is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 2 to 5 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of
8 inches over the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Lower amounts are expected across the northeastern section of Haiti
and the Dominican Republic, with amounts ranging from 1 to 3 inches
with isolated amounts around 5 inches.  Rain amounts of 1 to 2
inches are expected over western Jamaica.  Additional rainfall of
1 to 2 inches is expected over northern Colombia through tonight.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large
and destructive waves could raise water levels by as much as the
following amounts above normal tide levels...

Southern Coast of Cuba east of Cabo Cruz...7 to 11 feet
South Coast of Haiti...7 to 10 feet
Northern Coast of Cuba east of Camaguey...4 to 6 feet
Jamaica...3 to 5 feet
Gulf of Gonave in Haiti...3 to 5 feet
Southern coast of the Dominican Republic...1 to 3 feet

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.
Large waves generated by Matthew will cause water rises to occur
well in advance of and well away from the track of the center.

SURF:  Swells generated by Matthew will continue to affect portions
of the coasts of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Aruba, Bonaire,
Curacao, Venezuela, Colombia, eastern Cuba, and the Caribbean
coastline of Central America during the next few days.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
