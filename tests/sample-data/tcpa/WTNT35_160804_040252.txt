DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Earl was located
by an an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 17.4
North, longitude 87.6 West.  Earl is moving toward the west near 15
mph (24 km/h), and a westward or slightly north of westward motion
with some decrease in forward speed is expected over the next 48
hours.  On the forecast track, the center of Earl will move inland
over Belize within the next few hours, and move over the southern
Yucatan peninsula of Mexico or northern Guatemala on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is likely before landfall, and
Earl will begin to weaken after it moves inland over Belize on
Thursday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will reach Belize and Mexico within
the hurricane and tropical storm warning areas in a couple of hours.
Hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the hurricane
warning area in Belize and Mexico tonight.

RAINFALL:  Earl is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 8 to 12 inches over portions of Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, and
the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico through Thursday night.  Very heavy
rain will reach the Mexican states of Tabasco and Veracruz
between Thursday night and Saturday morning.  Isolated maximum
amounts of 18 inches are possible in Mexico and Belize.  These rains
could result in life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.

to 6 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of
