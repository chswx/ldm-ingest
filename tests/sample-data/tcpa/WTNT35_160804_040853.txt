DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Earl was located
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 88.9 West. A turn toward the
west-northwest and a decrease in forward speed are expected later
today.  On the forecast track, the center of Earl is expected to
move across central and northern Belize this morning, move across
northern Guatemala and the southern Yucatan Peninsula later today,
and be near or over the southern Bay of Campeche Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts, and additional weakening is expected as the
center moves farther inland.  Earl is forecast to weaken to a
tropical storm later this morning and to a tropical depression by
Friday morning.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Hurricane conditions are spreading through central and
northern Belize near the center of Earl.  Tropical storm conditions
are spreading across the coasts of Belize and Mexico elsewhere in
the warned area, and should spread into the southern Yucatan
Peninsula and northern Guatemala this morning.

RAINFALL:  Earl is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 8 to 12 inches over portions of Belize, Guatemala, and the
Mexican states of Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana, Tabasco and Veracruz
through Friday morning. Isolated maximum amounts of 18 inches are
possible in Belize, northern Guatemala and the central part of the
Mexican state of Chiapas.  These rains could result in
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

STORM SURGE: A storm surge along the immediate coast of Belize and
the eastern Yucatan Peninsula should subside today as the center of
Earl moves farther inland.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and damaging waves.
