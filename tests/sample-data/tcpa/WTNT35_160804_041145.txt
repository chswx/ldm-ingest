At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Earl was
located near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 89.5 West. Earl is
moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h). A turn toward the

today.  On the forecast track, Earl is expected to move across
northern Guatemala and southeastern Mexico today, and be near or
over the southern Bay of Campeche Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (105 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is expected as the center
moves farther inland, and Earl is forecast to weaken to a tropical
depression by tonight or Friday morning.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
to the east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.23 inches).

Belize, but should gradually subside. These conditions should spread

RAINFALL:  Earl is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 8 to 12 inches over portions of Belize, Guatemala, and the
Mexican states of Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and
Veracruz through Friday morning. Isolated maximum amounts of 18
inches are possible in Belize, northern Guatemala and the central
part of the Mexican state of Chiapas.  These rains could result in
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

STORM SURGE: A storm surge along the immediate coast of Belize and
the eastern Yucatan Peninsula should continue to subside today as
