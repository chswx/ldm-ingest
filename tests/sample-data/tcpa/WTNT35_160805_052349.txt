gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast before landfall.
After landfall occurs, rapid weakening of Earl's peak winds is
expected.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
