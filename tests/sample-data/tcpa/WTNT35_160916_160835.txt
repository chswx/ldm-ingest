At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ian was
located near latitude 45.2 North, longitude 40.8 West.  Ian is
moving very quickly toward the northeast near 48 mph (78 km/h), and
this motion is expected to continue through tonight, with a decrease
in forward speed expected on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is forecast during the next 36 hours, but
Ian is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone later today, and
be absorbed by a frontal boundary on Saturday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles (335 km)
