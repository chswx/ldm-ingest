DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was 
located by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near 
latitude 21.8 North, longitude 67.8 West. Franklin is moving toward 
the east-southeast near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this motion will 
gradually become more easterly and northeasterly today.  A sharp 
turn toward the north, with an increase in forward motion is 
expected tonight and Saturday, with a northward or 
north-northwestward motion over the western Atlantic continuing 
through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast by tomorrow, and Franklin 
will likely become a hurricane over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure from dropsonde data is 1003 
mb (29.62 inches).
