At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was 
located near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 65.8 West. Franklin is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h).  A sharp turn 
toward the north is expected later today, followed by a northward to 
north-northwestward motion over the western Atlantic through early 
next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Steady strengthening is forecast, and Franklin 
could become a hurricane within the next day or so.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
