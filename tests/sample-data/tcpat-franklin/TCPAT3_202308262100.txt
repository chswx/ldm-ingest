located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 67.5 West. Franklin is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a
north-northwestward to northward motion is expected over the western
Atlantic through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Further strengthening is forecast, and Franklin
could become a major hurricane early next week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

SURF:  Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting
Bermuda by Sunday night.  These swells are also likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend
into early next week along portions of the east coast of the United
States.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
