DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was 
located near latitude 23.9 North, longitude 68.2 West. Franklin is 
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A turn toward the 
north-northwest is expected on Sunday, followed by a northward 
motion into early next week.
 
Data from the Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunters indicate that 
maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Significant strengthening is expected during the next couple 
of days, and Franklin is forecast to become a major hurricane by 
late Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the 
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles 
(220 km). NOAA buoy 41046, located several hundred miles east of the 
Bahamas, recently reported a sustained wind of 49 mph (79 km/h) and 
a gust to 58 mph (93 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 
975 mb (28.80 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Franklin are expected to begin affecting
Bermuda by Sunday night. These swells are also likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions late this weekend
through early next week along portions of the east coast of the
United States. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
