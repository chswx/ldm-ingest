Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Rapid strengthening is forecast over the next 24 
hours, and Franklin could become a major hurricane by tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

weather office.
