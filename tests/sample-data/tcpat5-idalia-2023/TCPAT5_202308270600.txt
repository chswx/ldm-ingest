At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Ten was 
located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 86.8 West.  The 
depression is moving toward the southwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and

expected later on Monday, bringing the system over the eastern 
Gulf of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds remain near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast during the next few
days.  The depression is expected to become a tropical storm later 
today and a hurricane by Tuesday.  

A Weatherflow station on Cozumel recently reported a sustained wind 
of 36 mph (57 km/h) and a wind gust of 48 mph (78 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches)
